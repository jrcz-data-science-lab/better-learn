# Project Overview

**Better Learn** is a tool designed to help teachers create quiz questions faster and easier.

Currently, teachers need to manually add each question, which takes time and effort.
  
With Better Learn, teachers can:

- Upload PDF or PPTX files
- Extract text from PDF and PPTX files quickly
- Automatically organize the text in reading order
- Send the extracted text (as well as structured prompts) to a deployed LLM to generate test questions

This helps save time for teachers and reduce manual work.
